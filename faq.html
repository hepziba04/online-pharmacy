         <summary>What about generic drugs?</summary>
         <p class="text">Generic drugs are an excellent way to help avoid spiraling medical costs. Generics are approved and endorsed by the government. In other words, generic prescriptions are just as safe and as effective as brand name drugs and, in fact, have been found to have fewer recalls.</p>

         <summary>My mother puts all medications in the refrigerator. Should all medications be refrigerated?</summary>
         <p class="text">Proper storage of drugs is always on the label of a certified pharmaceutical. Follow those guidelines which may, in fact, call for refrigeration.</p>

         <summary>How long can medicine be used after the expiration date?</summary>
         <p class="text">There is some controversy when it comes to expiration dates, but I do think people need to be cognizant of expiration dates. Certain medications like insulin, nitroglycerin and liquid antibiotics are most sensitive to expiration dates. If you have questions about the potency and effectiveness of medications you take, always check with your doctor or pharmacist. You especially don’t want the elderly taking medication that expired years ago.</p>

         <summary>How should medicines be stored?</summary>
         <p class="text">Keep medications in a safe place and out of the reach of children and pets. Some medications need to be refrigerated, but the majority do not, and you can keep them in a dry place that’s not exposed to temperature extremes. Also, be sure not to mix up your medications. Keep each medication in its own distinct bottle unless someone is managing the dispensing of medicines via cassettes or pillboxes. Being able to distinguish one medication from another gets harder with age.</p>

         <summary>What vaccinations are important for seniors?</summary>
         <p class="text">People over age 65 are at higher risk for flu and should check with their doctor about the right flu vaccination. There are some restrictions for people with certain medical issues, but overall it’s recommended that most elderly people receive the flu shot. Also, anyone over 50 should consider the shingles vaccine, because singles has had a resurgence lately, especially among older people. If you don’t catch shingles in time, it has some long-term side effects including possible nerve pain and loss of vision. Also, for seniors 65 and older, the benefits of the pneumococcal vaccine is an important topic to discuss with their doctor.</p>

         <summary>What Should I Do if I Miss a Dose?</summary>
         <p class="text">
If you miss a dose of medication, do not assume that you should double up on your next dose. This can be dangerous with certain medications. Instead, call your pharmacy and follow the advice of your pharmacist.</p>

         <summary>Can I Break Pills in Half?</summary>
         <p class="text">
Often, pills and tablets can be broken in half, but others should be taken whole. Otherwise, these medications are unable to work as effectively as they should. Your pharmacist will know the details about your medication and whether or not you can break up pills or if they need to be taken whole.</p>
